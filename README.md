# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

Here I have used ML Algorithms to predict whether the Loan of the customer will get approved or not.

### Few insights that we got:

- Statistical information of int or float features:

- There are no null values

Here are a few visuals:

So loan approval or rejection does not depend upon how many dependents you have.

There is not much change in loan approval or rejection whether applicant is graduated or not graduated.
